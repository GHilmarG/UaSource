%%
%
% Calculates nodal reactions.
%
%   Reactions=CalculateReactions(MLC,l)
%
% Nodal reactions are due to boundary conditions. They are here calculated from the values of the Lagrange parameters (l) introduced
% when enforcing Dirichlet boundary conditions.
%
% Reactions is a structure with the fields:
%
%   Reactions.ubvb
%   Reactions.udvd
%   Reactions.h
%
% By setting the optional argument 
%
%    hReactionsExcludeActiveSet=true  
%
%
% any positive thickness constraints that were added automatically, ie not by the user, during the run are excluded. 
%
% Note that, for example, the h reactions are related to the additional mass flux required to keep the thickness at
% prescribed values. This fictitious mass flux (a_h) can be calculated as
%
%   ah=Reactions.h/(F.rho*F.time)
%
% So if, for example, rho and time are in IS units, the units of ah are kg/m^2
%
% l  : Lagrange variables
%
% l is one of the outputs of Ua available in DefineOutputs
%
%
%   Example:
%
% To calculate and plot reactions from within DefineOutputs
%
%   Reactions=CalculateReactions(CtrlVar,MUA,BCs,l); 
%   PlotReactions(CtrlVar,MUA,F,Reactions);
%
% Reactions are defined for all the nodes, but for nodes where no BCs have been applied,
% they will automatically be equal to zero. However, in the special case where no essential
% BCs are applied, reactions are returned as an empty matrix.
%
% If the multi-linear constraint matrix L was assembled in the FE basis, then the reactions
% are already physically correct and I only need to split them up in uv and h reactions.
%
% If L is a point-constraint matrix (default) then I need to map these into physical space
% using
%
%   lambda^* = M^{-1} L' lambda 
%
%  This gives lambda over all nodes.
%
% To restrict it to the nodes over which the constraints were applied use:
%
%     lambda^* = (L L')^{-1} L M^{-1} L' lambda 
%
%
%
% Note: If the active set has only been updated, but never applied, the dimensions of the Lagrange vector  (l.h) will be inconsistent with
%       the number of positive thickness constraints (BCs.hFixeNode).
%
% Also:  To plot reactions use:
%
%   PlotReactions(CtrlVar,MUA,F,Reactions)
