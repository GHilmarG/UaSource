function varargout = scarloc(featurename,varargin)
% SCARLOC returns coordinates of any of the 25,601 features identified by the Scientific Committee 
% on Antarctic Research (SCAR). http://www.scar.org/cga
% 
% Requires the data file scarnames.mat to be in a Matlab-findable
% directory.
% 
%% Syntax 
% 
%  [lat,lon] = scarloc(FeatureNames) 
%  latlon = scarloc(FeatureNames) 
%  [x,y] = scarloc(FeatureNames,'xy') 
%  xy = scarloc(FeatureNames,'xy')
%  [...] = scarloc(FeatureNames,'xy','km')
% 
%% Description 
% 
% [lat,lon] = scarloc(FeatureNames) returns geographic coordinate location(s) of an
% almost any feature(s) in Antarctica. FeatureNames can be string or cell array of 
% multiple locations. 
% 
% latlon = scarloc('Feature Name') returns the geographic coordinate location(s) of an
% almost any feature(s) in Antarctica. If only one output argument is used,
% column 1 corresponds to latitude and column 2 corresponds to longitude. 
% 
% [x,y] = scarloc(FeatureNames,'xy') returns polar stereographic (true latitude 
% 71°S) eastings and northings in meters.  
% 
% [y = scarloc(FeatureNames,'xy') returns polar stereographic (true latitude 
% 71°S) eastings and northings in meters. If only one output argument is used,
% column 1 corresponds to eastings and column 2 corresponds to northings. 
% 
% [...] = scarloc(FeatureNames,'xy','km') returns polar stereographic kilometers 
% instead of the default meters. 
% 
%% Example: Where is McMurdo Station? 
%
% [lat,lon] = scarloc('McMurdo Station')
% lat =
%   -77.8478
% lon =
%   166.6683
% 
%% Example 2: Same as above, with only one output: 
% 
% latlon = scarloc('mcmurdo station')
% latlon =
%   -77.8478  166.6683
% 
%% Example 3: Multiple locations: 
% 
% scarloc({'Byrd Camp';'Casey Station';'Pine Island Glacier'})
% ans =
%   -80.0833 -119.5333
%   -66.2833  110.5194
%   -75.1667 -100.0000
% 
%% Example 4: Multiple locations in polar stereographic coordinates: 
% 
% scarloc({'Byrd Camp';'Casey Station';'Pine Island Glacier'},'xy')
% ans =
%    1.0e+06 *
%    -0.9397   -0.5324
%     2.4470   -0.9159
%    -1.5958   -0.2814
% 
%% Example 5: As above, but polar stereographic kilometers: 
% 
% scarloc({'Byrd Camp';'Casey Station';'Pine Island Glacier'},'xy','km')
% ans =
%        -939.73       -532.39
%        2447.05       -915.86
%       -1595.76       -281.38
% 
%% Known Issues
% 
% Unfortunately, scarloc and scarlabel are plagued by problems with special
% characters. This includes letters with accents and umlauts. My sincerest
% apologies to our French, Norwegian, and just about everything aside from
% American friends.

%% strlookup
% The strlookup function follows: Documentation for strlookup can be found 
% at http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/47577-strlookup/content/strlookup_documentation/html/strlookup_documentation.html
function [ind,CloseNames] = strlookup(string,list,varargin)
% STRLOOKUP uses strcmp or strcmpi to return indices of a list of strings 
% matching an input string. If no matches are found, close matches are
% suggested.
% 
%% Syntax 
% 
% ind = strlookup('string',list)
% ind = strlookup(...,'CaseSensitive')
% ind = strlookup(...,'threshold',ThresholdValue)   
% [ind,CloseNames] = strlookup(...) 
% 
% 
%% Description 
% 
% ind = strlookup('string',list) returns indices ind corresponding to
% cell entries in list matching 'string'. 
% 
% ind = strlookup(...,'CaseSensitive') performs a case-sensitive
% strlookup. 
% 
% ind = strlookup(...,'threshold',ThresholdValue) declares a threshold
% value for close matches. You will rarely (if ever) need to use this.
% The ThresholdValue is a metric of how closely matches should be when
% offering suggestions. Low threshold values limit suggested matches to a
% shorter list whereas high thresholds expand the list size. By default,
% the threshold starts at 1.5, then increases or decreases depending on how
% many close matches are returned.  If fewer than 3 close matches are
% returned, the threshold is increased and it looks for more matches. If
% more than 10 close matches are found, the threshold is tightened
% (reduced) until fewer than 10 matches are found. 
% 
% [ind,CloseNames] = strlookup(...) suppresses command window output if
% no exact match is found, and instead returns an empty matrix ind and a
% cell array of close matches in names. If exact match(es) is/are found, 
% ind will be populated and CloseNames will be empty.
