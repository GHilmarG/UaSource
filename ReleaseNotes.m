%
% * uv and uvh solver now uses dog-leg seach if Newton back-tracking results in small steps.
%
%
% *Release Notes* _July 2022_
%
% * Call to DefineOutputs is now only done at the beginning and end of runs if the variables
%
%       CtrlVar.CreateOutputsBeginningOfRun=true;   % If true, then call DefineOutputs at the beginning of a run, that is ahead of the runstep/transient loop.
%       CtrlVar.CreateOutputsEndOfRun=true;         % If true, then call DefineOutputs at the end of a run, that is after the runstep/transient loop
%
% are set to true.
%
% * Calving options have been greaty improved and a flexible framework for implementing calving laws implemented. Although
% still considered not fully testet, this option appears to work quite well. Further details can be found in
% Ua2D_DefaultParameters.m and in the DefineCalving.m files. 
%
% * In the active-set method a minimum number of new active nodes can be specifed for the active set to be updated ahead of a
% new uvh solve, e.g.:
%
%   CtrlVar.MinNumberOfNewlyIntroducedActiveThicknessConstraints=5; 
%
%
% * UaPlots is a new plotting utility function.
%
% * Some minor bugs have been corrected, but nothing that should affect calculated solutions. 
%
% * This version requires MATLAB2021a or later.

%
% * Calving
%
% Calving can now be prescribed by defining a ice/ocean mask at each time step.
% The implementation is more general and faster than other similar manual
% calving options such as deactivating elements or prescribing an additional
% mass balance term.
%
% The ice-free areas are automatically melted away using a mass-balance feedback
% option implemented at the integration points. Second-order NR convergence is
% obtained even if the reulting mass balance distribution varies sigificantly
% spatially within an element
%
% To use this calving option set:
%
%      CtrlVar.LevelSetMethod=1;
%
% and then define the ice/ocean mask at each time step using the m-file
%
%      DefineCalving.m
%
%
%
% NOTE: Currently the only supported calving option is based on directly
% prescribing the LSF at each time step
%
%
% If you wanted, for example to get rid of all floating ice for x>500e3, do:
%
%
%
%         [UserVar,LSF,CalvingRate]=DefineCalving(UserVar,CtrlVar,MUA,F,BCs)
%           F.GF=IceSheetIceShelves(CtrlVar,MUA,F.GF);
%           OceanNodes=MUA.coordinates(:,1)>500e3 & F.GF.NodesDownstreamOfGroundingLines;
%           LSF=zeros(MUA.Nnodes,1)+ 1 ;
%           LSF(OceanNodes)=-1;
%         end
%
% Think of the LSF as a ice/ocean nodal mask, positive for ice and negative for ocean. 
%
% The the ice thickness in ice-free areas is
%
%   CtrlVar.LevelSetMinIceThickness
%
% While this could in principle be set to zero, doing so might create isolated
% islands of ice, resulting in an undetermined system. So put this to a some
% small positive value (small compared to typical ice thicknesses of interest).
% By default:
%
%    CtrlVar.LevelSetMinIceThickness=CtrlVar.ThickMin+1;
%
% where
%
%     CtrlVar.ThickMin=1;   
%
%
% Automated mesh refinement based on distance to calving from is possible in similar way as around grounding lines. For
% example to locally refine all elements with 10e3 distance units from the calving front to 1e3, use:
%
%   CtrlVar.MeshAdapt.CFrange=[10e3 1e3] ; 
%
% Remember also to set 
%
%   CtrlVar.AdaptMesh=1;
% 
% as always needed to activate the remeshing options.
%
%
% * New argument list option with F as an input
% 
% New:
%
%      DefineMassBalance(UserVar,CtrlVar,MUA,time,F)
%
% Old:
% 
%      DefineMassBalance(UserVar,CtrlVar,MUA,time,s,b,h,S,B,rho,rhow,GF)
% 
% The old approach still works and is generally recommended. 
%
% 
% * Geometry and densities can now be defined in the same m-file, using 
%
%      DefineGeometryAndDensities.m 
%
% The previous approach of using seperate m-files to define geometry
% (DefineGeometry.m) and densitites (DefineDensities.m) still works. But if you
% have a "DefineGeometryAndDensities.m" in the run folder, only
% "DefineGeometryAndDensities.m"  is used and "DefineGeometry.m" and
% "DefineDensities.m" ignored.
%
% * x and y nodal values now a field of F, ie F.x and F.y
%
% The (x,y) coordinates of the nodes are now also accessible through F as
%
%   (F.x,F.y)
%
% These are always identical to MUA.coordinates, that is
%
%   F.x=MUA.coordinates(:,1)
%   F.y=MUA.coordinates(:,2)
%
% This was simply done for convenience, and now one can, for example, create a plot showing the upper surface, s, as a function of x as
%
%   plot(F.x.F,s,'.')
%
% * Default inverse algorithim has changed. Now the defaul options is a
% Hessian-based inversion.  The older-approach is still available by selecting a
% Gradien-based inversion. This is specificed using the CtrlVar field:
%
%       CtrlVar.Inverse.MinimisationMethod
%
% When using this Hessian-based inversion, there is no need to specify the value of 
%
%       CtrlVar.Inverse.AdjointGradientPreMultiplier 
%
% and this field is not used.
%   
% * Ocean and wind-indued drag over floating ice can be included. This is defined in 
%
%   DefineSeaIceParameters.m
%
% and you need to switch this option on by setting
%
%   CtrlVar.IncludeMelangeModelPhysics=true;
%
% in DefineInitialInputs.m
%
% * The quadrature degree can now be directly specified using
%
%   CtrlVar.QuadratureRuleDegree=N
%
% where N is a number that can be as high as 25 (Previously the highest possible
% degree was 13). Generally, the default option should be fine, but there might
% be instances were increasing the degree could help with obtaining second-order
% convergence of the Newton-Raphson system.
%
% * The shallow-ice sheet (SIA/SSHEET) option now includes basal sliding.
%
% The SSHEET option is implemented for the Weertman sliding law only. The transient SSHEET solution is done implicitly with respect to
% the thickneess using the NR method.  When using SSHEET you will, in general, need to specify boundary conditions for both the
% deformational and the basal sliding velocities. Note the SSHEET option is based on the shallow-ice approximation.
%
% *Release Notes*
% _June 2020_
%
% * Naming of some user input m-files has changed: 
%
%
%       Ua2D_InitialUserInput.m  
%
% is now named:
%
%       DefineInitialInputs.m
% 
% And
%   
%       UaOutputs.m
%
% is now:
%
%       DefineOutputs.m
%
% These changes were done so that names of all user-input files start with 'Define'
%
% Note: To systematically change the names of all your old Ua2D_InitialUserInput.m and
% UaOutputs.m files you can, for example, consider using the m-file utility file:
%
%       RenameFileRecursively.m
%
% * Naming of a few CtrlVar fields has changed. For example
%
%       CtrlVar.ATStimeStepTarget
%
% is for example no longer used. Use:
%
%       CtrlVar.ATSdtMax
%
% instead.  
%
% You can now specify a minimum selected time step in the
% automated-time-stepping (ATM) algorithm settting the field
%    
%       CtrlVar.ATSdtMin
% 
% Also
%
%   CtrlVar.UaOutputsDt 
%
% has also been replaced by
%
%   CtrlVar.DefineOutputsDt 
%
% If you define these old fields in your (new) DefineInitialInputs.m, Úa will spot this and complain bitterly. 
%
% Those using Unix might want to systematically change names of some of the CtrlVar fields
% in there old input files. You might be able to use something like:
%
%   find . -name "DefineInitialInputs.m" -exec sed -i 's/CtrlVar.ATStimeStepTarget/CtrlVar.ATSdtMax/g' {} +
%   find . -name "Define*.m" -exec sed -i 's/CtrlVar.UaOutputsDt/CtrlVar.DefineOutputsDt/g' {} +
%
% * Exit criteria for the non-linear uv and uvh loops are now more flexible and allow for
% more options. See comments in 
%
%       Ua2D_DefaultParameters.m
%
% for more details.
%
% The
%
%   RunInfo
%
% variable now contains more information about the run, such as time step and number of
% non-linear iterations per runstep. 
%
% Most of the changes since last Feb 2020 have been 'under the hood'. For example solving
% a KKT type system can now be done with a much more flexible pre-elimination method than
% before.
%
% All line searches are now done using one single backtracking algorithm (before at least
% 4 different backtracking routines were used.) 
%
% The KKT system is now always solved using the primal-dual method. (Previously the
% initial iterative was made feasible and the primal method then used.) 
%
%
% *Release Notes*
% _February 2020_
%
%
% * Úa can now be called with CtrlVar as second argument, e.g 
%
%   Ua([],CtrlVar) 
%
% in which case the fields of the CtrlVar on input will be those used in the run
% even if these same fields are also defined in Ua2D_InitialUserInput.m
% 
% * The combination of local mesh refinement using the newest-vertex bisection method with
% mesh deactivation is now very flexible and allows for both reduction and extension of the
% computational domain during the run.
% 
% * Several new sliding laws are now implemented. These include Weertman, Coulomb, Budd, Tsai,
% Cornford, and  Umbi. Refer to the Ua compendium for definition of these
% different sliding laws. Inversion is also possible for all these sliding laws except for
% the Coulomb sliding.
% 
% * The semi-implicit time-stepping method now uses SUPG by default and when used the
% automated time-stepping algorithm ensures that time step fulfils the CFL condition.
% 
% * When using automated mesh refinement/coarsening in a time-dependent run, the upper
% surfaces are mapped between meshes and the thickness calculated afterwards. (Previously,
% the thickness was mapped and the surface calculated afterwards.) This may cause a
% potential violation of mass conservation. However, this also ensures smooth upper
% surfaces even when refining mesh over areas with very uneven bedrock topography.
% 
% * Inversion can be done using all implemented sliding laws except Coulumb. 
% 
%
% * u, v and h residuals now calulated in the L2 norm instead of the l2 norm as in the
% past. 
%
% *New user input file options:*
% 
%   DefineRunStopCriterion.m
% 
%   DefineFinalReturnedValueOfUserVar.m
% 
%   DefineOutsideValues
% 
% *Several new computational utilities* 
% 
%
%   LakeOrOcean3.m 
%
% is both fast and robust (Thanks to Sebastian Rosier).
% 
%   EleFlooding.m
%
% finds all nodes/elements connected to a given node fulfilling some
% additional criterion.
