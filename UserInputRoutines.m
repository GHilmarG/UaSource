%    All input to Úa is provided by user m-files.
%
%    The names of all, but one, of these user input files start with `Define'
%    For example: DefineDensities.m, DefineGeometry.m, etc.
%
%    All these user input files are listed below.
%
%   
%
%    Put copies of all the user input files that you think you will need for
%    your run into your local run folder.
%
%    In some cases you will not need some of the user input files. For example
%    if you are doing a forward run, you will not need the
%    `DefineInputsForInverseRun.m'. There is no harm in having a copy of this
%    user input file in your local run directory, but it will not be called by
%    Úa.
