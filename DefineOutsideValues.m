%
% Defines values outside of a previous computational domain.
%
% These values are used in a transient run when mapping
% (interpolating/extrapolating) from one mesh to another whenever some nodes of
% the new mesh are outside of the previous mesh. That is, when the new mesh has
% some nodes that are not within any of the elements of the previous mesh.
%
% This situation can arise when using, for example, manual deactivation of
% elements. If the domain increases in size, then some initial velocities and
% thicknesses must be defined over these new areas.
%
% Typically, some minimum thickness will be defined over the new areas and the
% velocities set to zero. The velocity values are only used as a start values for
% a diagnostic uv solution. Hence, the exact velocities prescribed are not
% important (provided the uv solution converges). However, the thickness
% prescribed over the new areas is important as it defines the new start values
% over any outside areas. Note that in a diagnostic (time-independent run) the
% thickness is always prescribed using DefineGeometry.m.  For that reason this
% routine is never used in a diagnostic run.
%
% Only return scalar values.

% Prescribe here outside thickness values of twice the minimum ice thickness.

% Make sure the s and b corresponds to flotation. However this is not essential
% as s and b are always adjusted internally based on h, S and B given rho and
% rhow.
